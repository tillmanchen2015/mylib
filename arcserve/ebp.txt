at the beginning of a function, it's common to push ebp and move esp to ebp. So, there are some conclusions.

ebp : parent ebp. 
ebp+4 : return address
ebp+8 : first parameter from parent function to push
ebp+ 0xC : second parameter from parent function to push
ebp - n : first local variable address( n is length of variable)
