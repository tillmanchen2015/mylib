AL/AH/AX/EAX/RAX: Accumulator
BL/BH/BX/EBX/RBX: Base index (for use with arrays)
CL/CH/CX/ECX/RCX: Counter (for use with loops and strings)
DL/DH/DX/EDX/RDX: Extend the precision of the accumulator (e.g. combine 32-bit EAX and EDX for 64-bit integer operations in 32-bit code)
SI/ESI/RSI: Source index for string operations.
DI/EDI/RDI: Destination index for string operations.
SP/ESP/RSP: Stack pointer for top address of the stack.
BP/EBP/RBP: Stack base pointer for holding the address of the current stack frame.
IP/EIP/RIP: Instruction pointer. Holds the program counter, the current instruction address.
Segment registers:
